#### What learning skill(s) do you need to continue to work on? Why do you feel this skill(s) needs work?

I feel like I need to focus on everything because I want to upgrade my skills and my skills are not perfect and I want to be proficient on all of my skills and I feel like I need to do even more like in math more algebra and for communication speak more clearly.
